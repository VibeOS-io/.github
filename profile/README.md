## 🌟 Our Mission

**Stop struggling with AI alone. Start creating with people who can show you how.**

vibeOS.io is building the first community platform where AI-savvy creators share knowledge, find collaborators, and co-create projects that would be impossible alone.

## 🎯 What We're Building

### 📚 Knowledge Sharing
Share how you use AI tools to 10x your output. Learn proven AI workflows from others who've cracked the code. Open exchange of prompts, techniques, and approaches.

### 🤝 Matchmaking
Find people who've mastered AI in domains you need. Connect based on complementary AI skills and project needs. Match vibes, not just skills.

### 🚀 Co-Creation
Team up to build projects neither could do alone. Combine different AI expertise areas for breakthrough results. Real collaboration, real projects, real impact.

## 📁 Our Resources

### [🎨 Vibe Everything](https://github.com/VibeOS-io/vibe-everything)

### [📋 Vibe Templates](https://github.com/VibeOS-io/vibe-templates)
